What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-- 
It creates a .git folder in my repository. Without any commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--
The staging area enables me to select which files I want to include into the commit. Logical commits and a finer selection are possible.



Commands:
git init 		: Creates a new rpository
git add 		: Adds files to the staging area
git status		: showes the status of the staging area
git commits 	: Creates a commit
