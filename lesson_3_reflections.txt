When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--
For storage and collaboration purposes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--
So you can work independent without interruptions on the project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--
That you have access to your original commit after merging.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
--
Using direct contact and sending back and forth files with individual requests. Would be way more time consuming!


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
--
Creating new branches allows having a sustainable stabile version of the project while working at the same time at new features and ideas.
